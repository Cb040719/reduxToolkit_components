# Redux-Toolkit Components
This project was built using [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite). It is a simple application that consists of two components, a `Counter` and a `TodoList`.

The `Counter` component is used to keep track of the number of items in the list, while the `TodoList` component allows users to add, delete and update items in the list. Both components are built using Redux Toolkit, which provides an easy way to manage state in React applications.

The project also uses Tailwind for styling, which provides a set of utility classes that make it easy to quickly style components without having to write custom CSS. Finally, Vite is used as the development environment for this project, allowing for fast builds and hot reloading during development. 

Overall, this project demonstrates how powerful Redux Toolkit can be when combined with Tailwind and Vite for building React applications.
